# Launcher Icons

This directory should contain the app launcher icons:
- `ic_launcher.png` - Standard launcher icon
- `ic_launcher_round.png` - Round launcher icon (for devices that support circular icons)

## Icon Sizes by Density:
- **mdpi**: 48x48 dp
- **hdpi**: 72x72 dp
- **xhdpi**: 96x96 dp
- **xxhdpi**: 144x144 dp
- **xxxhdpi**: 192x192 dp

## Design Requirements:
- Use earthy brown color palette (primary: #5D4037)
- Simple, calming design that represents motivation/mindfulness
- Meet Android launcher icon guidelines
- Include foreground and background layers for adaptive icons

## Temporary Solution:
For now, Android Studio will generate default launcher icons when the project is first opened. These should be replaced with custom-designed icons before release.
